![water_jebus](https://i.viamage.com/jz/snapshot-2020-04-20-18-28-33.png)

This template is attempt to make a working H3 HoTA template with sea.

We start with Jebus Cross and try various stuff!

### Changelog

#### 1.1.0

- Break value lowered to 40k. This is because islands are smaller than usual Jebus bioms and there are not so many creature banks in most cases.
- Limitation for amount of crypts. For some reason when generating islands, on many generations there were like 10 crypts and more. This should be resolved now.
- Attempt to limit amount of seers - doesn't seem to work properly, but it should no longer happen that 1/4 of island is filled with Seers.

#### 1.0.0

- Initial version. Two biom islands, one desert treasure islands. Two additional bioms in the underground, accessible from the desert. 


### Specifications

Same as on [h3hota.com](http://h3hota.com/en/templates#xl-u-templates/jebus-cross) but size H is recommended. 

### Some Remarks

- Sea generation is basically non-configurable in H3 HoTA mod, that makes it really painful to make "worth exploring".

- Some buildings will never generate, even if they are defined in Template Settings (like Seafaring Academy). 

- Some bioms may seem to have low value - it's worth to send a sea scout to look for nice buildings near the Island.
