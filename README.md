This template is attempt to make a working H3 HoTA template with sea.

We start with Jebus Cross and try various stuff!

### Specifications

Same as on [h3hota.com](http://h3hota.com/en/templates#xl-u-templates/jebus-cross) but size H is recommended. 

### Some Remarks

- Sea generation is basically non-configurable in H3 HoTA mod, that makes it really painful to make "worth exploring".

- Some buildings will never generate, even if they are defined in Template Settings (like Seafaring Academy). 

- It's quite hard to force multiple zones to "repulse each other", causes players' islands to be generated near each other. 

### Instructions
